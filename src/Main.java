/*
A car can drive. When it does, it returns a message saying “<car kind> <brand>”.
Follow the instructions below:
The Car class must be abstract. It has a brand that is given with the constructor. It has the drive method.
The AutomaticCar and ManualCar classes extend from Car and add the necessary code.
The Cars class has the getNextCar method that receives a brand and creates a random automatic or manual car to return it as a Car.
The Hansel class has the haveATry method that receives a Car and drives it to display the following message “I love this <car kind> <brand>”.
The CarTest class makes sure the drive method of both cars returns the correct text.
The CarApplication creates one Hansel and using the Cars class tries 10 cars.
